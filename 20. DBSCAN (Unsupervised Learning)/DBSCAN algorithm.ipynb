    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm, which groups together points that are closely packed together while marking points that lie alone in low-density regions as outliers. The main concept is to identify 'dense' clusters: it starts by exploring a small area, if enough data points are found within this area, it expands the cluster and repeats this process. The algorithm defines clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density. DBSCAN can find arbitrarily shaped clusters and is good at identifying outliers.\n",

    "Imagine you're organizing a large banquet and need to set up tables (clusters) for guests. The guests are the data points, and you want to group them based on their preferences and relationships, ensuring that everyone is seated comfortably.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN is like a smart seating arrangement strategy. You start by placing a few guests (data points) at a table (initial cluster). If you find that there are a lot of guests who share common interests with the initial group and want to sit close to each other, you add more chairs to the table, expanding the group (cluster). However, if a guest doesn't seem to fit well with any of the existing groups and prefers to be a bit apart, you let them have a seat at a smaller table or even alone, considering them as an outlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other methods that might force everyone into a specific number of tables or shape the tables in a certain way, DBSCAN allows for the natural formation of tables based on guest preferences (data density). Some tables might be larger, some smaller, and some guests might not fit into any table comfortably. This reflects how DBSCAN forms clusters based on the density of data points and allows for the existence of outliers.\n"
