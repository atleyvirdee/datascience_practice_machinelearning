    "# Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularization technique that combines the properties of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It is used when there are multiple features correlated with each other. Elastic Net solves some of the limitations of Lasso, such as the number of variables selected being limited to the number of observations, or data points, and issues with highly correlated variables. The elastic net method includes both the L1 and L2 penalty terms used in Lasso and Ridge Regression, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Elastic Net Regression is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{minimize} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \\beta_j)^2 + \\lambda \\left( \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2 \\right) \\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, \\(\\lambda\\) is the regularization parameter that controls the overall strength of the penalty, and \\(\\alpha\\) is a parameter between 0 and 1 that balances the contribution of the L1 and L2 penalties. When \\(\\alpha\\) is 0, the penalty is an L2 penalty (Ridge), and when \\(\\alpha\\) is 1, it is an L1 penalty (Lasso).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation in Layman's Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Elastic Net Regression as a chef who is an expert in both baking and cooking. When preparing a meal, there are times when using just baking skills (Lasso Regression) or just cooking skills (Ridge Regression) isnâ€™t enough to make the dish just right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is like this chef using a combination of both skills to create a meal. It allows the chef to balance the use of a wide variety of ingredients (predictors), similar to Ridge Regression, while also being able to selectively focus on a few key ingredients, like Lasso Regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is especially useful when dealing with recipes (data) where ingredients (features) are interrelated (correlated). For instance, in a complex dish, you might have different spices that can either complement each other or overshadow each other. Elastic Net, like our versatile chef, knows how to find the right balance by adjusting the use of each spice to get the best flavor (model performance).\n"
