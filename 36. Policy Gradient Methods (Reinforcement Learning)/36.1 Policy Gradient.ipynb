    "# Policy Gradient Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Gradient Methods are a type of reinforcement learning techniques used in machine learning. Unlike other methods that learn a value function to make decisions, policy gradient methods directly learn the policy function that maps a given state to a probability distribution over actions. This approach adjusts the policy parameters in a direction that maximizes the expected reward. One of the key benefits of policy gradient methods is their ability to handle high-dimensional action spaces and continuous action spaces.\n",

    "## Explanation in Layman's Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a chef experimenting with new recipes. Each ingredient, cooking time, and technique you choose is an 'action', and your goal is to find the perfect combination that results in a delicious dish (the 'reward'). In this scenario, you're not just randomly choosing actions; you're trying to develop an intuition or policy about what works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Policy Gradient Methods are like gradually refining your cooking intuition through trial and error. Each time you prepare a dish, you take note of how well it was received (the reward). Then, you adjust your cooking approach (policy) slightly, based on what you've learned. For example, if adding a bit more salt and cooking at a lower temperature yielded a tastier dish, you'll be more inclined to try similar actions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is that you're not just learning rules like \"always cook at low heat\" or \"always add two pinches of salt.\" Instead, you're developing a nuanced strategy that considers the current state of the dish and then makes probabilistic decisions. Itâ€™s a flexible approach, allowing you to adapt and try new techniques while also leaning on what has worked well in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, through many iterations of cooking and adjusting, you develop a sophisticated policy (or cooking style) that reliably produces tasty dishes, even in the face of new or complex recipes.\n"
