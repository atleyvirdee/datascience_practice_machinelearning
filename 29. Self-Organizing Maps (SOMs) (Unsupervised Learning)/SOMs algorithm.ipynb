    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples. They are a type of artificial neural network that is trained using competitive learning. SOMs are particularly useful for visualizing high-dimensional data in a way that highlights intrinsic patterns in the data, like clusters or groupings.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a chef with a huge array of ingredients and you want to create a system in your kitchen that helps you understand and visualize how these ingredients can be combined in your dishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a SOM in this context would be like placing a large, empty map or grid on your kitchen wall. Each ingredient starts with no fixed position on this map. As you begin to experiment with different ingredient combinations in your recipes, you start to notice certain patterns and relationships between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you might find that garlic, onion, and olive oil are often used together in many dishes. On your map, you'd place these ingredients close together. Similarly, you might find another set of ingredients that are commonly used in desserts and place them together in a different area of the map. Over time, this map organically develops into a detailed representation of your ingredients, grouped by how they are commonly combined in your cooking.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map (SOM) evolves and organizes itself based on the 'natural' groupings of the ingredients, driven by your cooking experiments (data analysis). This self-organized map helps you quickly see which ingredients complement each other, making it easier for you to create new recipes or modify existing ones.\n"
