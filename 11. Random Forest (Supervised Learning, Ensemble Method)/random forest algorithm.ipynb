    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. It's known for its high accuracy, ability to run in parallel, and flexibility to perform both classification and regression tasks. Random Forest helps to overcome the problem of overfitting, which is a common problem with decision trees. By combining multiple decision trees, it reduces the risk of staking the outcome on the predictions of any single tree.\n",

    "Imagine you're trying to decide what to cook for a dinner party. Instead of relying on just one friend's suggestion, you ask ten friends for their recommendations. Each friend considers different aspects â€” some think about the dietary restrictions of the guests, others focus on what ingredients are in season, and so on. You then make a decision based on the most common recommendation from all your friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest works in a similar way. It creates multiple decision trees (like asking multiple friends), each looking at different parts or aspects of the data. When it's time to make a prediction, it doesn't rely on just one tree. Instead, it looks at the predictions from all the trees and chooses the most common outcome (in classification) or the average (in regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is like gathering insights from a diverse group of friends. Just as your friends use their unique perspectives to give you a well-rounded view, Random Forest uses the diverse perspectives of multiple trees to make a more accurate and reliable prediction.\n"
