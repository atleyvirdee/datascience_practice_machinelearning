    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a type of autoencoder that's used in the field of deep learning for generative modeling. It's designed to not only compress data but also to generate new data that's similar to the input data. VAEs achieve this by creating a defined probabilistic space for the input data, from which new samples can be generated. The key feature of a VAE is its ability to produce this structured latent space, which captures the essential characteristics of the data in a way that allows for the generation of new, yet plausible data points.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a chef who wants to create a new recipe that's inspired by a particular cuisine. You have a lot of experience and a deep understanding of this cuisine, knowing its common ingredients, cooking techniques, and flavor profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A VAE in this context is like a process that helps you distill the essence of this cuisine into a set of key principles. You start by analyzing a variety of dishes from the cuisine, identifying common elements and themes. This is similar to how a VAE encodes input data into a structured latent space, capturing the core attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have these core principles, you use them as a base to experiment and create new dishes. These new dishes are not exact replicas of existing ones but are new creations that are true to the spirit of the original cuisine. In a similar way, a VAE can generate new data points that are not exact copies of the input data but share its fundamental characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to not just compress data but to use the compressed understanding to generate something new is what makes VAEs particularly exciting in fields like generative design, where the goal is to create new, innovative solutions while staying true to a set of underlying principles or constraints.\n"
