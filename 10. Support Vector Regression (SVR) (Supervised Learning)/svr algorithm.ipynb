    "# Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a type of Support Vector Machine (SVM) that is used for regression tasks. In SVR, the objective is to fit the best line within a threshold value (which is defined using a parameter called epsilon) in such a way that errors do not exceed this threshold. Unlike traditional regression models that try to minimize the error between the predicted and actual value, SVR focuses on fitting the best line within a predefined or threshold error limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SVR, we introduce something called the 'epsilon-insensitive tube'. This tube defines a range within which predictions are considered acceptable. The algorithm then tries to find a line (in two-dimensional space) or a hyperplane (in multi-dimensional space) that best fits the data points while keeping most of them within this tube.\n",

    "Imagine you are a chef who has been asked to prepare a dish that should weigh exactly 500 grams, but it's acceptable if the dish weighs within 495 to 505 grams. This range is your threshold. Now, your goal is to add ingredients in such a way that the final dish is as close as possible to 500 grams, but you're allowed some wiggle room (the epsilon-insensitive tube) without penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Regression (SVR) works in a similar manner. Think of the actual 500 grams as the target value you want to predict. SVR tries to get as close as possible to this target. The epsilon-insensitive tube is like the 495-505 grams range; it's okay if the predictions are within this range, and they won't be penalized. SVR aims to find the perfect balance of ingredients (predictors) to make a dish (prediction) that is satisfying (accurate) but still within the acceptable range (epsilon tube).\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows SVR to ignore minor errors (as long as they are within the threshold), focusing on the bigger picture (major trends in the data), which often results in a model that generalizes well on unseen data.\n"
