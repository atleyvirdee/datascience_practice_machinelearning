    "# MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm used in decision-making processes, notably in AI for board games like Go and Chess. MCTS combines the generality of random sampling (Monte Carlo methods) with the precision of tree search. The algorithm builds a search tree iteratively, node by node, based on random sampling of the search space. During each iteration, MCTS selects a path through the tree to expand, simulates a random play from that node, and then uses the results of that simulation to update the tree. This process balances between exploring new paths (exploration) and choosing moves that have been successful in the past (exploitation).\n",

    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a chef trying to develop a new, innovative recipe. You have several ingredients and techniques at your disposal, but the combinations are nearly endless, and you're not sure which will yield the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using MCTS in this scenario is like exploring different combinations of ingredients and cooking techniques through both experimentation and relying on past successes. Initially, you might randomly combine ingredients to see what works – this is the Monte Carlo aspect, where you're sampling different combinations to understand their potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you gather more data from these experiments, you start building a 'map' or 'tree' of combinations. Each branch represents a different path you can take – say, one path for adding more spices, another for cooking at a lower temperature, and so on. Each time you try a new combination, you update this tree with what you've learned about that particular path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, you start to identify which paths (combinations of ingredients and techniques) are most promising – either because they've led to delicious results in your experiments or because they're similar to combinations that worked well in the past. You then focus more on exploring these promising paths while still occasionally trying new, unexplored ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS, in the kitchen, is all about this balance between trying out new ideas and building on what you already know works, gradually leading you towards creating a recipe that is both innovative and delicious.\n"
