    "# t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) Algorithm\n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a machine learning algorithm used mainly for the visualization of high-dimensional data. It works by converting similarities between data points to joint probabilities and then minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence between these joint probabilities in high-dimensional and low-dimensional space. This results in a map that reflects the original data’s structure in a lower dimension (usually 2D or 3D for visualization). t-SNE is particularly good at creating a map that reveals clusters or groups in the data, even if those groups were not apparent in the higher-dimensional space.\n",

    "Imagine you’re a chef with a vast collection of recipes from all over the world, each with numerous ingredients, cooking techniques, and flavor profiles. You want to create a simplified map that groups these recipes into distinct cuisines based on their similarities, making it easier to navigate your collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-SNE is like a tool that helps you analyze all these complex recipes. It looks at each recipe and compares it with every other recipe based on ingredients and cooking methods. Then, it starts to arrange these recipes on a table (2D space). Recipes that are very similar to each other, say Italian pasta dishes, are placed close together, while those that are vastly different, like Japanese sushi, are placed far apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue this process, patterns start to emerge on the table. Closely grouped recipes represent a particular type of cuisine, and distances between groups reflect how different these cuisines are from each other. t-SNE has effectively taken a complex, multi-dimensional world of recipes and simplified it into a map that's easy to understand and visually navigate, revealing the hidden structure and relationships within your recipe collection.\n"
