    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori Algorithm is a classic algorithm used in data mining for learning association rules and discovering frequent itemsets in large databases. It's commonly used in market basket analysis to find items that are frequently bought together. The algorithm uses a \"bottom up\" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.\n",

    "Imagine you're a chef planning a menu for a restaurant, and you want to figure out which dishes should be included based on the ingredients that are commonly used together. Your pantry (database) is filled with various ingredients (items), and your goal is to identify combinations that are popular among your past recipes (transactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori Algorithm is like starting with one ingredient and gradually adding more to see what popular combinations emerge. For example, you start with tomatoes and notice that basil, mozzarella, and olive oil often accompany tomatoes in your recipes. This combination suggests a popular dish like a Caprese salad. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you continue, you might add another ingredient to this combination, like balsamic vinegar, and check if this new combination still appears frequently in your recipes. If it does, it suggests another popular dish variation. However, if you add an ingredient that doesn't fit well (like peanut butter with tomatoes and mozzarella), the combination will likely not be frequent in your recipes, and you discard this combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori helps you build up these ingredient combinations (itemsets) by checking the frequency of each new addition against your past recipes (database of transactions) to ensure that the final menu only includes dishes with combinations that are proven to be popular.\n"
