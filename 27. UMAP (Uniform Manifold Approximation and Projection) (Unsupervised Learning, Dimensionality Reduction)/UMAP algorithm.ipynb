    "\r\n",
    "UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualization similarly to t-SNE, but it differs in that it maintains more of the global structure of the data. UMAP works on the principle of manifold learning and topological data analysis. It aims to project the data from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space (typically 2D or 3D for visualization) in a way that preserves both the local and global structure of the data as much as possible.\r\n",

    "Imagine you're a chef tasked with creating a comprehensive cookbook that includes a wide variety of recipes from around the world. Each recipe has its own set of unique ingredients, cooking techniques, and cultural significance, making the entire collection extremely diverse and complex.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using UMAP in this scenario is like finding a way to organize this cookbook so that it's both easy to use and understand. You start by looking at each recipe and understanding its characteristics â€“ the ingredients, the cuisine it belongs to, the cooking method, etc. Then, you begin to layout these recipes in a large hall, grouping similar recipes together.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As you do this, you make sure that not only are similar recipes (like different types of pasta) close to each other, but also that entire cuisines or cooking styles (like Italian, Chinese, or grilling) are positioned in a way that makes sense in relation to each other. Italian dishes might be placed near other Mediterranean cuisines, highlighting both their similarities and distinctions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "UMAP helps you in creating an arrangement where someone can easily find a specific recipe but also explore and understand the broader landscape of culinary styles and techniques. It's a balance between seeing the 'big picture' of global culinary traditions while still appreciating the unique details of individual recipes.\r\n"
