## Topics Covered

## Supervised Learning Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**
    - Predicts a continuous output variable based on one or more input features.

2. **Logistic Regression**
    - Used for binary classification tasks (predicting a binary outcome).

3. **Decision Trees**
    - A flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature, and each leaf node represents a decision outcome.

4. **Random Forest**
    - An ensemble of decision trees, typically used for classification problems.

5. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
    - An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each correcting its predecessor.

6. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
    - Finds a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies data points.

7. **Naive Bayes**
    - A group of algorithms based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.

8. **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
    - Classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

9. **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting)**
    - Combines multiple weak classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers.

10. **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**
    - A scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines.

15. **Ridge Regression**
    - Addresses some of the problems of ordinary least squares by imposing a penalty on the size of coefficients.

16. **Lasso Regression**
    - Performs L1 regularization to allow for feature selection.

## Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

17. **K-Means Clustering**
    - Partitions n observations into k clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

18. **Hierarchical Clustering**
    - Builds a hierarchy of clusters either through a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach.

19. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
    - A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information.

20. **DBSCAN**
    - A density-based clustering algorithm.

21. **Affinity Propagation**
    - Creates clusters by sending messages between pairs of samples.

22. **Spectral Clustering**
    - Uses the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the similarity matrix to reduce dimensions before clustering.

23. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
    - A non-linear dimensionality reduction technique well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data for visualization.

24. **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
    - A computational method to separate a multivariate signal into additive independent non-Gaussian signals.
