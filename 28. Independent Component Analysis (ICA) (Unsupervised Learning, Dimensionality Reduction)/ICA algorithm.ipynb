    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a computational method for separating a multivariate signal into additive subcomponents. This technique is based on the assumption that the subcomponents are non-Gaussian signals and statistically independent from each other. ICA is commonly used in various fields, including digital images, document databases, economic indicators, and more. It's particularly useful in the field of signal processing, where the goal is to separate mixed signals into their individual sources.\n",

    "Imagine you're a chef who has been given a complex mixed stew made by combining several different dishes. Your challenge is to taste this stew and then deconstruct it back into its original, separate dishes, each with its distinct flavor and ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, the mixed stew represents the multivariate signal, and the original dishes represent the independent subcomponents you want to identify. Using ICA is like having a highly refined palate that can detect each individual flavor within the mixed stew. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you taste the stew, you're able to identify the distinct flavors and ingredients of each original dish. You recognize the tomato and basil from a pasta sauce, the coconut and spices from a curry, and the beef and vegetables from a stew. With this information, you can then reconstruct each of these dishes separately, essentially separating the complex mixture back into its individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, ICA works to separate complex signals into their independent components, even when the way they have been mixed is unknown. It's like using your culinary expertise to discern and extract the unique flavors from a blend, revealing the individual dishes that were combined to create it.\n"
